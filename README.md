For my gamepad instrument, I wanted to limit the voices, as I do not feel that this format lends itself well to polyphony.

Instead I have made one extremely interesting voice. 
Using a pfft~ device, I was able to grab a live sample with ezadc~, collecting some interesting visuals, and allowing me to use spectral data to create a held frozen tone!

From there on, I use xyz axis data from the gamepad object to allow for quantized stepped pitch, like a more playable theremin.
